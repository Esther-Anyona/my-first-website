  <p>My favorite things are just stuff or people that enrich my life. For instance, I love hanging out with my friends to celebrate our achievements or to just give a shoulder to lean on when going through life's storms. I turn to food as a consolation or when I am in high spirits and hosting family or friends.</p>
